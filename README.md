# **HEADLESS-FS**
**An open-source framework for advanced flight simulation systems.**

## **Introduction: So, what is HEADLESS?**

**HEADLESS-FS** is our current working title – and yes, it’s a bit of a joke. After all, who needs a fancy graphical interface when all the real magic happens in the backend? The name also doubles as an acronym:  
**"Hybrid Engine for Aircraft Dynamics and Live Environmental Simulation Support"**  
or, if you prefer,  
**"Highly Extensible Architecture for Dynamics and Live Environmental Simulation Systems."**

Sounds impressive, doesn’t it? But don’t worry – we’re not taking ourselves too seriously here. This project is all about giving developers a flexible, platform-independent foundation for flight simulations. Whether as middleware for existing simulators like X-Plane or MSFS, or as a basis for your own experiments, **HEADLESS-FS** aims to free up your mind for new ideas.

## **About the Project**
HEADLESS-FS is an ambitious open-source initiative designed to provide a highly flexible and modular backend for flight simulation enthusiasts and professionals. Inspired by the needs of developers who require precise dynamics, real-time processing, and seamless integration, HEADLESS-FS focuses on creating a middleware solution that bridges the gap between realism and extensibility.

## **Goals**
- Provide a modular and platform-independent backend for flight simulation.
- Enable real-time simulation of complex aircraft dynamics and environmental systems.
- Offer integration capabilities for existing simulators like X-Plane or MSFS.
- Create a robust foundation for standalone simulation environments.
