## Motivation

At **HEADLESS-FS**, our mission is to provide a highly flexible and modular backend for advanced flight simulation systems. To ensure that this project is accessible and attractive to a wide audience—including open-source enthusiasts, professional developers, and commercial entities—we are carefully selecting an open-source license that aligns with our goals.

Our aim is to foster a collaborative environment where developers can freely use, modify, and distribute **HEADLESS-FS**, while also protecting the interests of both contributors and users. By choosing the right license, we strive to balance openness with the necessary protections to encourage widespread adoption and innovation.

## License Roadmap

We are currently in the process of evaluating the most suitable open-source license for **HEADLESS-FS**. To make an informed decision that best serves our community and project goals, we invite all contributors and interested parties to participate in the [License Roadmap Discussion](https://github.com/mzau/HEADLESS-FS/discussions/categories/roadmap) on GitHub Discussions.
